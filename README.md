## Final submission v2.0
## Thought Process Simulation Engine

### Overview
The Thought Process Simulation Engine is a cognitive modeling project that simulates human-like decision-making. It introduces "thought agents" that compete to influence final decisions within a structured hierarchy. The project aims to explore internal cognitive conflicts and optimize multi-layered decision processing using fundamental computer science data structures.
### Features and Data Structures
Thought Agents (Set + HashMap): Models distinct decision-making influences and tracks their impact.

Hierarchical Thought Layers (Binary Tree + TreeMap): Represents structured reasoning and past decision trees.

Influence Evaluation (Priority Queue + Stack): Dynamically ranks agent influence with short-term memory tracking.

CLI User Interface: Allows users to input scenarios and view the most influential thought agentâ€™s outcome.
